JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures.

**JHipster Dotnet** will help you to start your project, by generating step by step only what you need.

- you will only generate the code you want, no additional unused code

## Prettier

We use the dotnet CLI to format our code

To launch format all code:

- go to the src folder which contains the ".editorconfig" file
- run in command prompt: dotnet format

## Generate your project

Go to https://localhost:7107, select your option and generate the code you want, step by step, and only what you need.

If needed more advanced features, go to https://localhost:7107/swagger/index.html and use your own JSON to generate the code you want. Here an example:
